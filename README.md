# Web Engineering 2022-2023 / Lab5 SOA

Please, go to the [GUIDE](docs/GUIDE.md) in order to get the instructions for this assignment.

Some ideas for obtaining a :gift: if you are the first that:

- [Use Camel for providing a WebSocket endpoint for queries](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/websocket-jsr356-component.html); a websocket client is required.
- ~~[Use Camel for keeping a copy of responses in a database](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/jdbc-component.html)~~ [ZenithGD](https://github.com/ZenithGD/lab5-soa/tree/work)
- [Enrich the response with moustache](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/eips/content-enricher.html); remove moustache from the client.
- [Create an operator "-" to filter out tweets that contain a keyword](https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/eips/filter-eip.html)

Note: unless the goal specifies o disallows a specific framework you are free to replace the framework used in the original implementation with a different framework.

Manifest your intention first by a PR updating this `README.md` with your goal.
If you desist of your goal, release it by a PR so other fellow can try it.
